			<h1>Josh Duff</h1>
<p>I've spent more than a decade turning customer needs into technical specs and delivering software slowly and steadily over many small iterations/deliverables.  I've delivered software solutions as an individual, and as a member of small teams.</p>
<p>I have worked with various database systems, but spent the most time with MySQL.  I have worked on desktop and web applications, but mostly web applications since ~2010.</p>
<p>I have experience with large web frameworks, but am comfortable building a toolbox out of composable libraries.</p>
<p>There are many examples of my open source code linked below if you are interested in seeing my coding style or skill.  If you want to chat about hiring, email <a href="mailto:me@JoshDuff.com">me@JoshDuff.com</a>.</p>
