I've spent over a decade building desktop and web applications for various industries.  I turn customer needs into technical specs and deliver software slowly and steadily over many small iterations/deliverables.

I've delivered software solutions by myself, and as a member of small teams.

I have experience with large web frameworks, but am comfortable building a toolbox out of composable libraries.  I have worked with various database systems, but spent the most time with MySQL.
